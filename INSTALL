Installing QCA
--------------

Installation should be straightforward:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

NOTE: You may also need to run '/sbin/ldconfig' or a similar tool to
      get the new library files recognized by the system.  If you are
      using Linux, just run it for good measure.

You then need to install any plugins that you want. For each 
subdirectory in the plugins/ directory, you do the same sequence
of events:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
