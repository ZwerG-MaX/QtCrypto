Description
-----------

  QCA is a library that provides an easy API for a range of crypographic
  features, including SSL/TLS, X.509 certificates, SASL, OpenPGP, smartcards,
  and much more.

  Functionality is supplied via plugins.  This is useful for avoiding
  dependence on a particular crypto library and makes upgrading easier,
  as there is no need to recompile your application when adding or
  upgrading a crypto plugin.

  In order for QCA to be of much use, you'll want to install some plugins.

  QCA was originally created to support the security needs of the
  Psi XMPP/Jabber client project ( http://psi-im.org/ ).


Have fun,
-Justin
