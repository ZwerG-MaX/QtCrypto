Qt Cryptographic Architecture
-----------------------------

This library provides a skeleton API for the following features:

  Hashing (SHA1, MD5)
  Ciphers (3DES, AES)
  X509
  SSL/TLS
  SASL

Your application will compile and link in all cases, regardless of
whether or not the installed QCA actually supports the features you
need.  Functionality is provided via plugins, which are loaded
automatically.
