This directory holds simple unit tests for QCA.

Note that some of the hash tests require data files which are not
provided with the QCA download because of their size. This is not a
problem - the tests will simply be skipped if the files are not
present. If you want to exercise these tests, you need to copy (or
link) Botan-1.4.1.tar.bz2, linux-2.6.7.tar.bz2 and scribus-1.2.tar.bz2
tarballs as distributed into the unittest/data/ directory. These files
should be readily available on the Internet. There is also a zero
length file (imaginatively called "empty"), which you can create with
something like "touch ./data/empty" at the command line.
