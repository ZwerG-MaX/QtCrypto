This directory holds simple unit tests for QCA.

You can run the whole test suite by doing "make check" in this
directory. You can also run a single set of tests by doing "make
check" in the applicable subdirectory.

Note that some of the hash tests require data files which are not
provided with the QCA download because of their size. This is not a
problem - the tests will simply be skipped if the files are not
present. If you want to exercise these tests, you need to copy (or
link) Botan-1.4.1.tar.bz2, linux-2.6.7.tar.bz2 and scribus-1.2.tar.bz2
tarballs as distributed into the unittest/hashunittest/data/
directory.  These files should be readily available on the
Internet. There is also a zero length file (imaginatively called
"empty"), which you can create with something like "touch
./data/empty" at the command line.

These tests are implemented using the QTestLib test framework provided
with Qt 4.1 and later. If you are having trouble with a test, you can
get more information by running the test applicable directly (e.g. if
you can't make the Base64 test work, you run the ./base64unittest
executable) with the -v1 or -v2 options. You can also specify a single
test to be run. 

Thanks to Trolltech for providing Qt and agreeing to release QTestLib,
especially to Harald Fernengel for all the development work, a great
tutorial at Akademy 2005 and substantial assistance with QTestLib.
