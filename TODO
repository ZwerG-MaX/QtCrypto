* update the README
* special thanks to Jack Lloyd
* mac universal binary support?
* be sure to turn ALL .pro files (examples, everything) on release mode
* option to build qca with simultaneous debug and release, similar to qt?

* API documentation
  think about documenting the various providers (qcaprovider.h)
  Change Doxyfile config to capture whole API, and to generate Latex manual.

* beta4
  api:
    some functions report availability of "sub"features without having context
      with a specific provider (that is, the functions are not members of an
      instance owned by a provider, nor is a provider necessarily specified
      as an argument to the function).  in these cases, if a feature is
      reported as being available, it is not clear how the app can actually
      use the feature.  For example, if the static method TLS::canCompress()
      returns true, it is entirely possible that when the application creates
      a "new TLS;" instance, it won't be served by a provider that supports
      compression.  possibly offending functions:
    qca_publickey.h:
      supportedGroupSets
      supportedTypes
      supportedIOTypes
      supportedPBEAlgorithms
    qca_cert.h:
      canUseFormat
      canUsePKCS7
    qca_securelayer.h
      supportedCipherSuites
      canCompress
    cert extensions
      fixup subjectInfoOrdered to handle all DN parts (oids) ?
    crl URIs
    policy info beyond OID
    OCSP ?
    random: either find a way to always provide good random numbers,
            or add an indicator as to whether the numbers can be
            trusted.
    tls extensions: hostname and ocsp stapling
    QSecureArray/QBigInteger -> QCA::SecureArray/QCA::BigInteger ?
    alon: convertToPublic should return a publickey rather than clone?
    ability to create PKCS#1 without using direct low level crypto.
  code:
    fix the locking stuff in qca_core
    allow logger to be used from anywhere
    global random thread-safety?
    tls/sasl
    fix asker implementation, it is a disaster
    dirwatch: thread safety
    dirwatch: test on all platforms
    qca-openssl: ca signing
    synchronizer should lazy-start the thread
    proper parenting of all objects
    qca-gnupg: ignore newlines from passphrase, to avoid advancing command-fd
    qca-cyrussasl: make this plugin (use misha's patch to qca-sasl)
    sasl example
    qcatool TODOs
    constraints stuff seems messed up.  why are constraints auto-added by
      qca-openssl?
  other:
    krazy warnings
    Update to latest Botan, and remake the botantools patch as appropriate
       - remove u32bit miller_rabin_test_iterations(u32bit bits, bool verify)
    ability to compile plugins in statically (check 'plugins' subdir)

* Considerations
  api:
    Q_DISABLE_COPY on some objects
    give all classes non-default ctors/dtors/copy/op=, and dpointers?
    add more "getters" to the library?
    don't forget to QCA_EXPORT everything
    it's possible we use QSecureArray in some unnecessary places
  other:
    add asserts
    standardize on count() vs size() when iterating?
    printf + latin1()/toLatin1() -> qPrintable() ? (in code/examples/docs/etc)
    qca-cyrus-sasl has a problem where we can create the provider, and not create
    a saslContext, and then the destructor depends on uninitialised values (to
    see this, valgrind staticunittest).
    link against our own lib (e.g. -L../../lib) before ALL other libs,
      including Qt's libs, since some distros put qca into qt's dir?
  alon:
    allow formating subjectInfoOrdered into string in certificate object.

* finish code for APIs:
  core: properties
  cert: rfc 2818 hostname validation
  publickey/cert cleanup
  securemessage
  tls
  sasl
  keystore: cleanup
  don't allow smart card providers to be used by default
  qca-openssl: we have email altname but not email DN?

* examples
  create example for BigInteger
  create example for OpenPGP
  create example for CMS
  fix SASL examples (client and server)

* Additional unit tests (using QTestLib):
  - OpenPGP
  - CMS
  - TLS ?
  - SASL ?
  - QPipe
  - FileWatch / DirWatch
  - Complete the pkits tests

* write plugin support
  qca-botan: implement
  qca-egads (or qca-egd): implement for Random support

* possibilities for the future:
  securemessage: algorithm selection for cms/pgp (and use SecurityLevel?)
  tls: SSL_get_client_CA_list
  tls: renegotiation
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  quoted-printable TextFilter
  keygen on smart cards
  keystore: symmetric keys, arbitrary app data
  cms: fine-grained control over smime attribs
  providers for:
    Mozilla NSS
    Windows CryptoAPI
    Linux kernel crypto support, if the userspace API ever gets sorted out
    Intel Performance Primatives library
