* plugins: thread safety ?
* sasl: server last (SASL_SUCCESS_DATA)
* ssl: compression yes/no
* ssl: set/get ciphers
* ssl: get connection info (cipher name and bits, etc)
* ciphers should be 'filters', not BufferedComputations
* other modes: ofb, etc?
* pkey: ability to choose sign algorithm
* pkey: ability to choose cipher for toDER/PEM passphrase
* cert: Distinguished Names (Botan has X509_DN)
* cert: get signature algorithm
* cert: constraints, ex_constraints, policies, pathLimit, isCA, isSelfSigned
* cert: other functions?
* crl: add functions
* base64 filter code
* blocking mode for ssl/sasl ?
* pgp
* xmlsec
* pgp: understand gpg KEYEXPIRED
* securearray: do copy-on-write instead of all the time, don't use SecureVector
* built-in sha1 and md5
* botan init cleanup
* install on top of Qt.  usage then is simply LIBS += -lqca
