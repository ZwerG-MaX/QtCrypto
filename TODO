* beta6
  api:
    it's possible we use SecureArray in some unnecessary places
    CMS::setUntrustedCertificates
    Q_DISABLE_COPY on some objects
    give all classes non-default ctors/dtors/copy/op=, and dpointers?
    add more "getters" to the library?
    don't forget to QCA_EXPORT everything
  code:
    cert: rfc 2818 hostname validation
    keystore: complete
    securelayer: complete
    qcatool: configurator for pkcs11 and generic
    qcatool TODOs
    finish cmssigner
  other:
    update README/INSTALL
    special thanks to Jack Lloyd
    winlocal didn't work, what now?

* test1
  doc:
    documentation overhaul
    document provider interface
    document which functions might cause a synchronous asker:
      pkey: sign/decrypt, or any non-KeyLoader privkey/keybundle loading
      keystore: entryList (non-async), ensureAvailable, ensureAccessible
      securemessage: waitForFinished
    Change Doxyfile config to capture whole API, and to generate Latex manual.
  code:
    synchronizer: cleanup
    publickey: cleanup
    cert: cleanup
    keystore: cleanup
    securelayer: cleanup
    securemessage: cleanup
    add logging to qca lib and other plugins
    add more asserts?
  other:
    regenerate botantools.diff
    update the rootcerts with mozcerts
    make sure the version is correct in all locations (README, etc)

* examples
  create example for BigInteger
  create example for OpenPGP
  create example for CMS
  create example for using TLS with smart cards (maybe reuse ssltest?)
  fix SASL examples (client and server)

* additional unit tests (using QTestLib):
  - OpenPGP
  - CMS
  - TLS ?
  - SASL ?
  - QPipe
  - FileWatch / DirWatch
  - Complete the pkits tests

* write plugin support
  qca-botan: implement
  qca-egads (or qca-egd): implement for Random support

* possibilities for the future:
  emsa3Encode: implement in provider instead of qca?
  OCSP
  tls ocsp stapling
  internally managed intermediate object storage
  securemessage: algorithm selection for cms/pgp (and use SecurityLevel?)
  tls: renegotiation
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  quoted-printable TextFilter
  keygen on smart cards
  keystore: symmetric keys, arbitrary app data
  cert: any other fields we don't support but might be used out there
  cert: support for arbitrary extensions?
  cms: fine-grained control over smime attribs
  convertToPublic should return a publickey rather than change itself
  providers for:
    Mozilla NSS
    Windows CryptoAPI
    Linux kernel crypto support, if the userspace API ever gets sorted out
    Intel Performance Primatives library
