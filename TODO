* Additional unit tests
* API documentation

immediate:
* cipher: other modes: ofb, etc?
* pkey: ability to choose sign algorithm
* pkey: ability to choose cipher for toDER/PEM passphrase
* cert: Distinguished Names (Botan has X509_DN)
* cert: get signature algorithm
* cert: constraints, ex_constraints, policies, pathLimit, isCA, isSelfSigned
* crl: add functions
* tls: compression yes/no
* tls: set/get ciphers
* tls: get connection info (cipher name and bits, etc)
* sasl: server last (cyrus' SASL_SUCCESS_DATA)
* tls/sasl: blocking mode?

later:
* new api's: pgp, smime, xmlsec
* store: support read-only access of system rootcerts (win, mac, debian)
* default provider should have built-in sha1 and md5 (?)
* qca: thread safety ?
* plugins: thread safety ?
* qca-tls: do something about the cert check lag.  maybe a thread?
* pgp: understand gpg KEYEXPIRED
* install on top of Qt.  usage then is simply LIBS += -lqca
