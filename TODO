* examples
  create example for BigInteger
  create example for OpenPGP
  create example for CMS
  create example for using TLS with smart cards (maybe reuse ssltest?)
  fix SASL examples (client and server)

* additional unit tests (using QTestLib):
  - OpenPGP
  - CMS
  - TLS ?
  - SASL ?
  - FileWatch / DirWatch
  - Complete the pkits tests

* write plugin support
  qca-botan: implement
  qca-egads (or qca-egd): implement for Random support

* possibilities for the future:
  publickey: use_asker_fallback should use ErrorPassphrase
  publickey: ability to compare keys without IO support
  provider: separate public and private keys into two classes to enable
    delegation easier.  the public part should not be implemented by most
    providers.
  provider: make it possible to support RSA and DSA keys without implementing
    a separate class for each.
  cert: better makeFriendlyName diffing for key usage (consider OIDs) ?
  qcatool: streaming securemessage operations
  qcatool: instead of printing full usage at every wrong turn, we might try
    to print something closer to the context
  access to list of known cached certs, similar to how cmssigner works?
  securemessage: ability to know which key has performed a decrypt?
  emsa3Encode: implement in provider instead of qca?
  OCSP
  tls ocsp stapling
  tls: pgp, psk auth ?
  internally managed intermediate object storage
  securemessage: algorithm selection for cms/pgp (and use SecurityLevel?)
  tls: renegotiation
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  quoted-printable TextFilter
  keygen on smart cards
  keystore: symmetric keys, arbitrary app data
  cert: any other fields we don't support but might be used out there
  cert: support for arbitrary extensions?
  cms: fine-grained control over smime attribs
  convertToPublic should return a publickey rather than change itself
  providers for:
    Mozilla NSS
    Windows CryptoAPI
    Linux kernel crypto support, if the userspace API ever gets sorted out
    Intel Performance Primatives library
