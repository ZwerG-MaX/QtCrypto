* Additional unit tests
* API documentation
* Threading consideration (safety, usability) in API and plugins

* finish API:
  cert: Distinguished Names (Botan has X509_DN)
  cert: constraints, ex_constraints, policies, pathLimit, isCA, isSelfSigned
  crl: add functions

* finish code for APIs:
  cipher
  mac
  pkey
  cert/crl/store (don't forget to call detach())
  tls
  sasl
  store: support read-only access of system rootcerts (win, mac, debian)
  default provider should have built-in sha1 and md5 (?)

* write plugin support
  qca-tls: do something about the cert check lag.  maybe a thread?

* consider new APIs:
  pgp (go beyond cutestuff and support key expiration, validity, etc)
  smime
  extra x509 stuff discussed in the summer with kiko
  xmldsig
  xmlenc (sort of done already in cutestuff/xmlsec, but need to qca-ify)
  padding - a way to do any possible padding approach, so advanced users
            can turn off the default padding scheme, and pass in a 
            pre-padded last block.
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  Password based key derivation functions - RFC2898
  pkey: ability to choose cipher for toDER/PEM passphrase ?
    - botan doesn't seem to allow this, but kiko wanted it...

* qt 4 upgrade:
  new include styles
  use qmake .prf for auto-discovery by applications
