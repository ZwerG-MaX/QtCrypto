* update the README
* special thanks to Jack Lloyd
* mac universal binary support?

* API documentation
  think about documenting the various providers (qcaprovider.h)
  Change Doxyfile config to capture whole API, and to generate Latex manual.

* beta4
  code:
    qca-gnupg: ignore newlines from passphrase, to avoid advancing command-fd
    qca-gnupg: support async
    qca-openssl: EVP_PKEY_bits() doesn't always return the full key size
    qca-openssl: why are some constraints auto-added?
    qca-openssl: ca signing
  other:
    krazy warnings
    Update to latest Botan, and remake the botantools patch as appropriate
       - remove u32bit miller_rabin_test_iterations(u32bit bits, bool verify)

* beta5
  api:
    cert: crl URIs
    cert: policy info beyond OID
    alon: convertToPublic should return a publickey rather than clone?
    reporting diagnostic text at the provider level?
    document which functions might cause a synchronous asker?
    async console prompter
  code:
    keystore: complete, async mode, clean
    qca-cyrus-sasl:
      there's a problem where we can create the provider, and not create
      a saslContext, and then the destructor depends on uninitialised values
      (to see this, valgrind staticunittest).
    qca-openssl: support async S/MIME and TLS
    core: properties
    cert: rfc 2818 hostname validation
    tls/sasl
    publickey/cert cleanup
    securemessage
    synchronizer should lazy-start the thread
    don't allow smart card providers to be used by default
    add logging to qca lib and other plugins

* test1
  code:
    dirwatch: thread safety
    dirwatch: test on all platforms
    proper parenting of all objects
    qcatool TODOs
  other:
    update the rootcerts with mozcerts

* Considerations
  api:
    Q_DISABLE_COPY on some objects
    give all classes non-default ctors/dtors/copy/op=, and dpointers?
    add more "getters" to the library?
    don't forget to QCA_EXPORT everything
    it's possible we use SecureArray in some unnecessary places
  other:
    add more asserts
    standardize on count() vs size() when iterating?
    printf + latin1()/toLatin1() -> qPrintable() ? (in code/examples/docs/etc)

* examples
  create example for BigInteger
  create example for OpenPGP
  create example for CMS
  fix SASL examples (client and server)

* Additional unit tests (using QTestLib):
  - OpenPGP
  - CMS
  - TLS ?
  - SASL ?
  - QPipe
  - FileWatch / DirWatch
  - Complete the pkits tests

* write plugin support
  qca-botan: implement
  qca-egads (or qca-egd): implement for Random support

* possibilities for the future:
  emsa3Encode: implement in provider instead of qca?
  OCSP
  tls ocsp stapling
  internally managed intermediate object storage
  securemessage: algorithm selection for cms/pgp (and use SecurityLevel?)
  tls: renegotiation
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  quoted-printable TextFilter
  keygen on smart cards
  keystore: symmetric keys, arbitrary app data
  cms: fine-grained control over smime attribs
  providers for:
    Mozilla NSS
    Windows CryptoAPI
    Linux kernel crypto support, if the userspace API ever gets sorted out
    Intel Performance Primatives library
