* cipher: option to specify size for genkey
* cert: properly check hostnames with wildcards
* ssl: rename to tls
* ssl: change plugin API to not need Q_OBJECT
* ssl: error signal

* openssl plugin: fixmes and todos
* more optimal plugin loading:
    plugins should have versions and names
    load on demand
    ability to add classes as plugins
    ability to set priorities to plugins by name and feature

* ssl: client-specified cert
* dsa
* diffie-hellman

* figure out where to install the lib and plugins. maybe Qt plugin path?
