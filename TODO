* Additional unit tests

* API documentation
  clean up Algorithm
  clean up Filter
  add TextFilter
  add Hex
  add Base64
  add QCA::systemStore() and haveSystemStore()

* Threading consideration (safety, usability) in API and plugins

* finish API:
  cert/crl: Distinguished Names (Botan has X509_DN)
  cert: turn Info into an enum
  cert/pkey: fingerprints (is there a standard for this?)
  cert: subjectAltName
  qcaprovider.h -> qca_provider ?

* finish code for APIs:
  cipher - needs to handling padding
  mac
  pkey
  cert/crl/store (don't forget to call detach())
  tls
  sasl
  store: system rootcerts (win, mac, debian)
  default provider should have built-in sha1 and md5 (?)

* examples
  create example for Hex
  create example for Base64
  create example for Random
  create example for BigInteger
  update cipher example (after API sorted out)
  add systemStore() example

* write plugin support
  qca-tls: do something about the cert check lag.  maybe a thread?
  qca-botan: implement
  qca-egads (or qca-egd): implement for Random support
  qca-openssl: need to implement locking callbacks.
  figure out why Valgrind reports so many memory leaks

* consider new APIs:
  pgp (go beyond cutestuff and support key expiration, validity, etc)
  smime
  extra x509 stuff discussed in the summer with kiko
  xmldsig
  xmlenc (sort of done already in cutestuff/xmlsec, but need to qca-ify)
  padding - a way to do any possible padding approach, so advanced users
            can turn off the default padding scheme, and pass in a 
            pre-padded last block.
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  Password based key derivation functions - RFC2898
  pkey: ability to choose cipher for toDER/PEM passphrase ?
    - botan doesn't seem to allow this, but kiko wanted it...
    - jack looking into it
  cert/crl: path limit, subject/issuer ids (only useful for create/validate)
  cert: constraints, ex_constraints, policies (same as above)
  crl: revoked list (serial, time, reason) (same as above)

* qt 4 upgrade:
  new include styles
  use qmake .prf for auto-discovery by applications
  use qplugin
