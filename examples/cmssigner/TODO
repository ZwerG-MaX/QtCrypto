icons needed:
  app icon (may need different sizes of this?)  (a pen?)
  keystore icon (a box?)
  keystore entry identity icon (a card?)
  file identity icon (a file?)  (keybundle icon?)
  cert icon (a piece of paper?)  (cert icon?)

have a graphical busy indicator for:
  keystores are busy? (maybe a flashing thing in the status bar)
  sign operation in progress (maybe just use an endless QProgressBar)

entry icons
  key bundle
  cert
  crl
  pgp secret
  pgp public

store icons
  system
  user
  application
  smart card
  pgp keyring

unknown store/entry icon (can use the same icon for both i think)
