app icon (may need different sizes of this?)  (a pen?)
store icons
  system
  user
  application
  smart card
  pgp keyring
unknown store/entry icon (can use the same icon for both i think)
animation rather than text for keystore busy?
animation for signing in progress (maybe just use an endless QProgressBar?)
integrated logger window?  also allow setting the log level
prompter should not call entrylist unless necessary.  right now it starts
  async mode on all stores, even if there is no prompting or anything going
  on.  qcatool has this problem also
report all 3 kinds of diagnostic text somewhere
  plugin: plugin dialog invoked from file menu ?  also show provider versions
  keystore: invoked from keyselectdlg ?
  secmessage: "details" button on error dialog?

further cleanup
don't remember pkcs12 password if it was wrong
when verifying a signature:
  if the key is valid, import it and ask the user for a friendly name and
    import into keyring
  if the key is self-signed, ask the user to verify the fingerprint. if
    validated, ask user for friendly name and import into keyring
